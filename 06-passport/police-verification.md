# Police Verification Process

## What is Police Verification?

Police verification is a mandatory process where local police verify your address and check for any criminal records before passport issuance.

## Types of Verification

### 1. Post-Verification (Normal Application)
- Passport issued before police verification
- Verification done after passport dispatch
- Faster process

### 2. Pre-Verification (Tatkal/Sensitive Cases)
- Verification done before passport issuance
- Passport issued only after police clearance
- Takes additional time

## Verification Process

### Step 1: Police Station Assignment
- Your application is forwarded to local police station
- Based on permanent address

### Step 2: Police Visit

### Step 4: Report Submission
